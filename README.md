### Build your Portfolio

#### These are my recommendations on building a Portfolio

* Create your Blog and publish as you learn. The first two options doesn't require you to be technical to set things up;
    * Hashnode
    * Dev.to
    * Or create a more personalized website using Wix, Webflow, or Wordpress.
* Contribute to Open source Projects.
